# MirrorWorldsHTMLServer

Finished:
- socket connection
- chat function
- 1st and 3rd person views
- avatars added
- changable avatars
- small environment events

Future Milestones:
- Enviroment Watch List so that environment is always up to date
  - need to have multiple scene events
  - probably need some other kind of event besides turning on a light
- New Avatars (more compact and less warthoggy)
- Increase Efficiency (some lag with multiple users)

Bugs:

- When a new user connects and there are already users in the scene, the new user isnâ€™t seeing where everybody really is at first. All other users are being rendered from the spawn location
- Random semi colon in the middle of the x3d scene
- Headlights on avatars (should be fixed when we add new avatars)
- Teapot needs a material
